    "This project aimed to explore the relationship between GDP and life expectancy, identify trends over time, make predictions, and detect anomalies within the dataset. The analysis provided several key insights:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation Between GDP and Life Expectancy:**  \n",
    "   Contrary to initial expectations, there was no strong global correlation between GDP and life expectancy. However, when analyzed individually, each country exhibited its own linear trend. Despite this, regression models for each country failed to meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity, likely due to the limited data available. This suggests that while GDP may influence life expectancy within a country, other factors play a crucial role.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trends Over Time:**  \n",
    "   Over time, most countries experienced an increase in life expectancy, reinforcing the idea of overall global health improvements. In contrast, GDP trends were more varied: while most countries had stable GDP growth, the United States and China showed significant economic expansion. China's rapid GDP rise since 2006, in particular, was not accompanied by a proportional increase in life expectancy, highlighting potential economic and policy influences beyond just wealth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Predicting Life Expectancy:**  \n",
    "   Given the data constraints and model limitations, attempts to predict life expectancy based on GDP were unreliable. The failure of the models to meet key statistical assumptions indicates that GDP alone is insufficient to accurately estimate future life expectancy, as other socio-economic, healthcare, and policy factors likely play a role.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anomaly Detection:**  \n",
    "   Several anomalies were identified:  \n",
    "   - Chile vs. Zimbabwe: Despite having a GDP comparable to Zimbabwe, Chile maintains a significantly higher life expectancy, suggesting that economic wealth alone does not determine public health outcomes.  \n",
    "   - China's Economic Surge: Initially displaying an average GDP, China experienced a sharp economic acceleration after 2006, yet this growth did not translate into a corresponding leap in life expectancy, pointing to potential disparities in wealth distribution, healthcare access, or other socio-political factors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Thoughts:**  \n",
    "While GDP and life expectancy are often assumed to be strongly correlated, this study reveals a more complex, country-specific relationship. The results suggest that while economic growth can contribute to public health improvements, other factors must be considered. Future work with a larger dataset or additional socio-economic variables could improve the reliability of models and lead to a deeper understanding of these relationships.  "
