# **GDP vs Life Expectancy Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project explores the relationship between **GDP and life expectancy** across different countries. The analysis investigates whether higher GDP leads to longer life expectancy, identifies trends over time, detects anomalies, and assesses the reliability of predictive models.  

## **Data**
Dataset provided by Codecademy.

## **Key Findings**  
- There is **no global correlation** between GDP and life expectancy, but each country follows its **own linear pattern**.  
- Most countries show an **increase in life expectancy over time**, while GDP trends vary.  
- Predictive models were **not reliable** due to data limitations.  
- Notable anomalies include **Chile's high life expectancy despite a low GDP** and **China's rapid GDP growth after 2006 without a proportional life expectancy increase**.  

## **Files**  
- `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.  
- `all_data.csv` – The dataset used in this project. 

## **Tools & Libraries**  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)  

## **How to Use**  
1. Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the cells to explore the data and visualizations.  
3. Modify or extend the analysis as needed.  

## **Conclusion**  
This study highlights the **complex relationship** between economic growth and life expectancy, emphasizing that GDP alone is not a reliable predictor of public health.
